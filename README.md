Spotify Party Controller

Web-app that allows users to connect and listen to music from the Spotify catalogue together. One user hosts a party, and others may jpin said party and request a song to be added to the playback queue. Similiar to making a request to a DJ. Only now you dont need to ask, it can happen right form your mobile device.
